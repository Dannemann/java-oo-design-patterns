/**
 * <p>The game rendering engine. Generates each frame the user sees on screen.</p>
 * <p>This is the <b>ConcreteComponent</b> UML actor.</p>
 * <p>An emulated game can apply various filters to enhance image quality. While
 * some filters are provided by the emulator's development team, many are
 * created by the community. Since new shaders or antialiasing techniques may
 * emerge unexpectedly, it's important to keep the system flexible and open to
 * these additions. To achieve this, hard-coding filter implementations directly
 * into this class would lead to unnecessary complexity, making it difficult to
 * maintain and extend. Instead, we can use the Decorator design pattern to keep
 * this class focused on its primary responsibility: rendering a game frame.
 * Once the frame is rendered, we can apply any filter (or series of filters)
 * that the user selects, providing a highly flexible and extensible solution.</p>
