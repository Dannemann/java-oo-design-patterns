# Strategy design pattern (behavioral)

Enables selecting and swapping algorithms at runtime. Provides different implementations of the same behavior.

For this example, imagine you are an employee at Google Maps working on route calculations. Users can select from various transport types, such as car, bike, or motorcycle. Each algorithm (strategy) calculates the optimal route based on the chosen transport type and GPS coordinates.
